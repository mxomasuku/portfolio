[{"pageContent":"# Greetings\r\n\r\nMy name is Mxolisi Blessed Masuku. I am a frontend developer from quite alot of cities in Zimbabwe. I specialise in React development, and looking to learn everything React from the front, the back and Native. \r\n\r\nOn the side, I am a High School science teacher, and I started Web Development because a friend recommended it would be the best way to have autonomy over my blog. Turned out it was a trap, 3 years later, I find myself looking to learn more and now, start getting serious jobs, tackle real world problems and,\"use my code for good.\"\r\n\r\nThis site is supposedly a portfolio website to help me get front-end work online and in my community, but I see it growing into a window to what happens in mind and help me link up with other people who share the same interests with me. \r\n\r\nIf you are already viewing this, then I hope you are one of those people. \r\n\r\nCiao amigo!\r\n\r\n\r\n## How I built this site.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that there are alot of unnecessary features on this site. To be fair, I too dream about having a lean portfolio/personal site. But for now, I gotta practise everything I can on this one thing I care about on the internet.\r\n\r\nAs someone who recently fell in love with React, and the React Ecosystem. The first thing I had to do was to learn how React as a framework 'reacts' with Javascript and the most basic low level support library. That means instead of using Gatsby, I had to learn how to render using 'react-markdown'. Instead of using Next.JS, I had to master how React-router-dom works and hopefully develop an appreciation of the problem Next.JS came to 'save us' from. With that said, I do have a medium scale project I am doing with Next.JS. You can inquire about it here.\r\n\r\n## The Styling : Chakra UI\r\n\r\nIf you are looking to learn more about Chakra as an option for styling, checkout my article \"Chakra vs Tailwind vs Bootstrap \r\n\r\nChakra is a hybrid child of React & Javascript. Styles are applied as inline jsx. Much like how you add inline classes when styling with Tailwind CSS.\r\n\r\nI chose Chakra firstly because it was created by a Nigerian developer. But on top of that, Chakra UI provides uniformity. These days good design is good UI. It may look pretty, but the key thing is the feel it produces. Chakra UI, as the name suggests, targets User Interfaces. It minimises the amount of React code and CSS styling you would write if you were writing a normal CSS framework like Bootstrap and Tailwind.\r\n\r\nPlus, I think Chakra looks nicer too. {Insert comparison between Tailwind and Chakra code.}\r\n\r\n## \r\n\r\n"}]
