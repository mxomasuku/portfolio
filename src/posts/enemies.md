When his enemies surrounded him, he let out a sharp scream!!!!!! Lord lord lord!
Before I moved to Harare, I worked in Kwekwe for 10 years. That's when I started my service in the Central Investigations Department C.I.D. Kwekwe is a city like no other but in some sense, it has a recipe which most cities in Zimbabwe are built on. 

The first ingredient to make a successful town is a University, College or Polytechnic. If you are one of the believers, you are probably thinking, this is good for education bla bla bla. And you are wrong to think that. A university or college ensures a consistent supply of fresh young pussy and women for the city. This is enough to keep the young men, and older enough motivation to work. It will ensure that the clubs are full, the clinics are vibrant, and visiting the CBD is rewarding. Whether you can get them or they are out of your league, who doesn't like seeing young youthful vibrant women doing their thing and showing off skin to anyone gracious enough to look?
