# Why you should consider building your web app on top of React?

React is gold! Seriously. It is that one technology on the web that looks like it's not going away anytime soon. It has changed the way developers build website and thought of the web, and its children Next.Js, Nuxt etc continue to do at an astounding pace. Like I said, it is the gold that every other web economy is built upon. 

But just because React is gold, doesn't mean there aren't any other economies built on other commodities like Oil, Agriculture etc. Those are your other technologies like Angular, Bubble, WordPress etc. 

### What you should be looking for 
Power. Control. Flexibility. Speed. Affordability And great cutting edge support in the unlikely event that something goes wrong.

If you are here, there is a chance that you have come across ads about no-code platforms like Bubble that tell you that you can develop a website or webapp in 30 minutes! Don't buy that crap. They are costly. Unless your business is making tonnes of money and can afford to pay Bubble a substational fee to host your App then don't do it. Plus, as you will notice, 30 minutes isn't 30 minutes. You should also know some foundational CSS, Design Principles and Prototyping. 

What React offers you, is the ability to hire someone (like me), to develop an app for you, and when they do. They built a small, light and lightining fast website to help you showcase whatever goodies you want the world to see. This very site you are on, is built on React. Look how fast it is. 

What's beautiful is that you never have to worry about the code, because I will set you and your team up nicely on a good CMS (Content Management System) that will make posting on your website as simple as posting a Tweet. Only that you will be the Elon Musk of your website or web app. 

### Let's talk flexibility for a bit. 
There are certain things that React on its own can't do, like connect to your backend data, server. It was designed mainly for display and presenting data. However, like a good piece of gold, it works well with its children. 

Suppose you have a separate server out there, what do you do? In that case, we either use something called 'react-router-dom', a package designed to give React backend superpowers, or we just go nuclear and use Next.JS. Everyone is using Next.JS these days, I will probably sound like a fool if I go around strutting how deeply immersed I am in React, 

Not to worry though, Next.JS is called a React framework, it was built to help you write and deploy your React App faster. How is that for kids making sure the bloodline lives forever.

### WordPress vs React.
